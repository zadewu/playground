# Middle weighted of the sliding frame
## Problem describe
### **INPUT**:
- First line contain two number *n (the length of input stack)* and *s (the size of the frame)* separated by a space
- 0 < n <= 1030000
- 0 < s <= 15001, s%2 == 1
- Next *n* line contain single number *x (the value)*
- 0 <= x <= 9
- The input will be pass as an input stream, so you must extract the values as describe above yourself
### **OUTPUT**:
- The frame slide from top to down (or from left to right depend on how you imaginate the input stack)
- Every frame, print the **middle weighted number** of the current frame on a single line without any trailing space to the given output stream
- How to calculate the **middle weighted number**?
- A frame is a collection of number without ordering, the **middle weighted number** is the number stay in the middle of array after sorted by ascending order
- ex: frame: [1, 9, 2, 7, 4] -> frame after sort: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9] -> the number in the middle is 4
